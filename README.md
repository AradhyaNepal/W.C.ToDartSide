## Welcome to the Dart side! ðŸ˜ˆ

In this app, you can do all the Dart things like Custom Paint, Animation, ShaderMask, and so on and still not get caught. ðŸ˜ˆ

No stranger can take screenshots or record videos or view your Dart secrets in the recent apps.

** I have to record my app from another device because a screen recorder was also not allowed when the secure mode was on.

Here is the APK: [TOUCH ME!!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/132uOrSJIwJCRDkqS3bRYYxt8z0VezHH2/view)
